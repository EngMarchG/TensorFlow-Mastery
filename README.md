### Developing With TensorFlow
This repository tackles a variety of projects in order to get familiar with the TensorFlow Framework.

[1. Regression With TensorFlow](https://github.com/EngMarchG/TensorFlow-Mastery/blob/master/1_Regression/01_Neural_Network_Regression_With_TensorFlow.ipynb)
This section introduces the basics of tensorflow and many methods that are incorporated in the framework from other modules. Later on, a simple introduction the steps to building a model using the Sequential Model approach.
The main takeaways are:
- Creating a Model, compiling it and fitting it
- Learning how to expand the dimensions or squeeze it 
- Predicting and Evaluating the model
- Understanding different optimizers and metrics for 

[2. Classification With TensorFlow](https://github.com/EngMarchG/TensorFlow-Mastery/blob/master/2_Classification/02_Neural_Network_Classification_With_TensorFlow.ipynb)
This section further elaborates on the Sequential Modelling in TensorFlow. 
The key takeaways are:
- Tweak the model after evaluating it
- Visualize data to further understand it
- Finding the best learning rate (around 10x before the lowest point)
- Building Binary and Multi-Class Classification Models
